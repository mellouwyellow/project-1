      <p>Beginning in 1996, Flash Player was a computer software you had to download and ran on most internet browswers. In the early 2000's, it was the main support for games many kids born in the early 2000's played such as:
        Poptropica, Club Penguin, Dino Run, Papas Pizzeria and many more.
    Here is a puffle! You could play minigames to catch new ones, feed them, play with them, and name them!  </p>
